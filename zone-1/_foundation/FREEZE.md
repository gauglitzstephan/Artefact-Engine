This directory contains the frozen Zone-1 foundation of the artefact-value engine.

The specifications in this folder:
- define binding authority
- define information boundaries
- define change mechanics
- define minimal observability

They MUST NOT be modified casually.

Any change requires:
- a formal Change Request
- explicit justification
- versioned replacement
- review of downstream impact

Default behavior is stability.
