title: Operating Model Freeze
status: frozen
scope: B-block (Operating Model V1)

This folder contains the frozen operating authority of the system.

The operating model:
- defines roles and decision rights
- enforces asynchronous defaults
- protects Zone-1 integrity
- prevents support creep and meeting inflation

It MUST NOT be modified casually.

Any change requires:
- a formal Change Request
- explicit justification
- versioned replacement
- review of downstream impact

Default behavior is stability.
