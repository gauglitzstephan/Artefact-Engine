# Artefact-Centric Governance Repository

This repository defines a governance-first, artefact-centric system. It is a structural foundation, not a product repository or codebase.

Zones:
- Zone 1: frozen authority and binding specifications.
- Zone 2: workbench for drafts, reviews, and analysis.
- Zone 3: exploration space.

Action follows artefacts, not discussion.
